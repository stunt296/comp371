* The terrain is generated by going through a 2D float array (a heightmap) that holds the <x,z> positions of the map and the y value for the height of the cubes It calls glDrawArrays for every face that is visible, aka it renders all the faces of the cubes that are above the height of the neighboring cubes.
* The different texture is illustrated by changing the color of the cement texture from lab 04.
* The water is generated by adding a blue, translucent top face above every top face that is below the designated water level.
* The trees are generated by going over the heightmap, checking if the <x,y,z> is above water level, if yes then it calculates a 1% chance of placing a tree in that area, and if it is true then it checks to make sure the tree placement would not collide with another treeâ€™s placement. If this is all true, it adds the position to a position vector. In the main while loop, it draws the trees based on the position vector.
